        "blogDetailedDescription": "Hailo, the pioneering chipmaker of edge artificial intelligence (AI) processors, today announced that HP has selected the Hailo-10H AI accelerator to power its all-new HP AI Accelerator M.2 Card. HP is the first to market with a Hailo-10H based solution, revolutionizing how retail and hospitality providers engage with customers, optimize operations, and scale intelligent insights. The collaboration between HP and Hailo brings AI-driven capabilities directly to the edge, enabling real-time insights, predictive analytics, and autonomous transactions across retail and hospitality environments. As businesses navigate rising customer expectations and persistent challenges like theft and operational inefficiencies, the need for advanced, on-device intelligence has never been greater. Market trends reflect this urgency: Self-checkout technology is experiencing explosive growth, with the global market expected to climb from $5.71 billion in 2025 to $18.14 billion by 2034. Meanwhile, retail shrinkage – a $100 billion annual problem driven by theft, fraud, and operational errors – continues to challenge the industry.",
